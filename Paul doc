OK, I made some JUnit tests and some classes. The classes I made so far are QuestionList, Question, AnswerList and Answer. I know it deviates a bit from the UML diagram we discussed. Hopefully you guys don't mind, but we can always change it up on Monday or something. The Question class has an answerlist (from AnswerList class) and the question itself (a string). The QuestionList class is pretty much just an arraylist of Questions. The AnswerList class is an arraylist of Answers. The Answer class is comprised of the answer itself (a string) and an arraylist of replies. By the way, I just named the project QueueUnderflow, we can always change it later.
